### Threadpool!

This program is 95% similar to the amazing example of https://github.com/user-none/. An explanationand further options can be seen from the blog where this code has been found: https://nachtimwald.com/2019/04/12/thread-pool-in-c/#object-data.

Since the original work has been distributed under an MIT license, so has this code. Thanks to John for the work and implementation.
